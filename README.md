# Logistic-regression
In this project I tried to implement logistic regression and regularized logistic regression by my own and compare performance to sklearn model.

# Model Description
In class LogisticRegression the class takes different args that you need to modify according to your dataset.
here in this project I used [machine learning course presented by Prof.Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) exercise 2 dataset that contains 100 rows and 3 columns.

**Note:** This project is also supporting regularized logistic regression which can be used by setting Lambda args to something 
not 0.

# Sample Output
Here you can see how the algorithm acts and plots cost history:

As you see the cost values reduced over time and almost converged to 0.

And here you can see the decision boundary:

# Conclusion
At last but not least, I highly appreciate any comment over this project.
Thanks in advance
